Everyone talks about delayed gratification and maintaining consistent long-term focus as things you can just wake up and magically decide to do. Well you can't.

At least I know I can't.

Raw discipline is *difficult*. I refuse to believe that the kind of natty, intrinsic, pull yourself up by the bootstraps discipline that self-help books froth at the mouth over is anything but an extreme rarity, found in true outliers. Even then I'd sooner classify it as a myth than anything most people can derive value from emulating.

I say all of this as someone who can, and often does single-mindedly stalk goals to completion. But never out of any inherent willpower or ability. In fact, I often feel that out of my peers, I am the most at mercy to my brain's [electrochemistry](https://discoelysium.fandom.com/wiki/Electrochemistry).

And that's because [greedy decision making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) is such a simple paradigm to move through life with. Why make locally difficult choices for the prospect of long-term rewards when I can simply push the dopamine button at every turn.

### Easy vs Hard Discipline

So how does one get things done in this world of infinite temptation and ever decreasing willpower? 

The framework I've landed on revolves around the observation that I have quite sharp peaks and troughs in motivation, with a general inverse proportionality with time of day. My actions reflect my transition from Jekyll to Hyde, the goal being to make consumption decisions when I have more clarity so as to rob myself of the optionality later on. 

I *know* that if I'm up at two in the night and the desire for snacks starts creeping in, there won't be much stopping me from clearing every cupboard and digging through every drawer. At the same time, for most of my daily existence I'm quite rational about my needs and wants. 

Easy discipline is when you make a choice at the decision barrierâ€”where your willpower is high and the desire for any particular "negative" action is low (not buying snacks when you're out shopping). This bumps up the effort required to undertake said action later (I want to snack late at night). 

Of course, the flip side of this is that you lose the optionality of ever snacking at home, even in situations where it would be fine to indulge. 

Alas, this optionality is only available to those who can commit to hard discipline: buying the snacks, knowing it makes it easy for you to overconsume during the night, but trusting that you won't.

### Weaponized Procrastination

But what about things that aren't gated by external decisions? Choosing to practice an instrument or spend five hours grinding ranked in League isn't something that can be access-separated temporally short of locking your computer away for the night. 

This is where I utilize my next biggest strength: procrastination. I keep a decently large rotation of things I *should* do `{study, work out, climb, practice guitar, write, ...}`, each with its own variable level of effort required. Then, when I don't feel like doing something difficult, I just context switch into something else that is marginally easier or more fun and keep the cycle going as my interest wanes.

### tl;dr
- Natty discipline is hard
- People make greedy decisions
- Getting things done requires you to first figure out how you tick
- Then it's all about creating the right framework to exploit your tendencies and force yourself into the long-term +EV path while ALSO making short-term +EV decisions
